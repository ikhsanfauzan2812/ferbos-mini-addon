## Configuration

The addon can be configured through the Home Assistant addon configuration:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "database_path": "/config/home_assistant_v2.db"
}
```

## Security Notes

- Only SELECT queries are allowed for security reasons
- The addon runs with limited privileges
- Database access is read-only
- All queries are logged for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database not found**: Ensure the database path is correct and the file exists
2. **Permission denied**: Check that the addon has access to the database file
3. **Port conflicts**: Change the port in the addon configuration if 8080 is already in use

## Development

To run locally for development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_PATH="/path/to/home_assistant_v2.db"
export PORT=8080

# Run the application
